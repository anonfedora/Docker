The engine consists of three major components:

1. Docker Daemon: The daemon (dockerd) is a process that 
keeps running in the background and waits for commands 
from the client. The daemon is capable of managing 
various Docker objects.

2. Docker Client: The client (docker) is a command-line 
interface program mostly responsible for transporting 
commands issued by users.

3. REST API: The REST API acts as a bridge between the 
daemon and the client. Any command issued using the 
client passes through the API to finally reach the 
daemon.


According to the official docs,

"Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker 
client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy 
lifting of building, running, and distributing your 
Docker containers".

You as a user will usually execute commands using the 
client component. The client then use the REST API to 
reach out to the long running daemon and get your work 
done.
